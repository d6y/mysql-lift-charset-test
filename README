So you think you have a character encoding problem, eh?

This Lift app attempts to insert UTF-8 data into a table it creates and then show
you what comes back.  

By default the table is called foo, with a username and password of foo (see Boot.scala).
We assume MySQL.

When you run the app, visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 and see the data inserted and
what is recovered when the table is queried.

Instructions:

1) Set up a MySQL database:

$ mysql -u root -p --default-character-set=utf8
MYSQL> CREATE DATABASE foo CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
MYSQL> grant all privileges on foo.* to 'foo'@'localhost' identified by 'foo';
MYSQL> flush privileges;

2) Run the app:

$ sbt jetty

3) open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and see the results.
